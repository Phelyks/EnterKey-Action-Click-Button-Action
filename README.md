In web UI design, offering users the flexibility to perform an action either by clicking a button or pressing a key button enhances accessibility and user experience.

Providing both options accommodates diverse user preferences and behaviors, contributing to a more intuitive and efficient interaction model.

This approach aligns with principles of inclusivity and usability, empowering users to choose the input method that best suits their workflow and accessibility needs.

Additionally, it can streamline tasks, reducing friction and enhancing overall satisfaction with the web application.

By prioritizing user choice and convenience, designers can create interfaces that cater to a broader range of users and improve engagement and usability.
